Conditional offers will be rejected.\\nNo extensions to the program start date will be permitted.\\nThe three-week rule has been removed, meaning late visa applications may still be accepted, but timely processing cannot be guaranteed.\\nWhat You Should Do:\\nSecure your unconditional offer letter as early as possible.\\nSubmit your visa application well in advance of your course start date.\\nMake travel plans carefully, keeping the new rules in mind.\\nWe urge all students considering Ireland as a study destination to take note of these changes and act promptly.
